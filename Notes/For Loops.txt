Types of For Loops in C++

1. Traditional for loop:
-This loop consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
-It is commonly used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

 for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // Loop body
}

2. Range-based for loop:
-This loop is used to iterate over elements in a container or array.
-It is concise and easier to read, especially when you need to access each element in a collection.

for (declaration : range) {
    // Loop body
}

Example:
std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int num : vec) {
    std::cout << num << " ";
}
