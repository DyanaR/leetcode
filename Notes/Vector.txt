Dynamic Array (std::vector)

-when created, it doesn't have a set size. You can give it a set size, but you do not need to give it a size. It is created, elements are put into it and the size grows. 

-so can start an array without knowing how many elements are going to be in it, then push as much as needed.

Syntax: 
vector<int>& int
